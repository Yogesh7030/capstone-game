# Capstone Turtle Game

This is a single-player arcade-style game built using Python's `turtle` module. The player must cross a road filled with moving cars and reach the top of the screen. Each time the player successfully crosses, the game level increases and the cars move faster.

## How to Play

- **Move Up:** Use the **Up Arrow** key  
- Controls can be changed in the `main.py` file

**Objective:**  
Reach the top of the screen without colliding with any cars.  
Each successful crossing increases your level and the car speed.

## Features

- Single-player gameplay with basic keyboard input
- Car objects that move across the screen at varying speeds
- Collision detection that ends the game on contact
- Scoreboard showing current level
- Speed increases with each level to raise difficulty
- Organized using Python classes and modules

## Project Files

- `main.py` – Entry point; sets up the screen and game loop  
- `capstone.py` – Contains the player class and movement logic  
- `car_block.py` – Defines car behavior and controls car movement  
- `scorecard.py` – Manages score and level display  

You only need to run **`main.py`** to start the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Built-in Python libraries only:
  - `turtle`
  - `random`
  - `time`

## How to Run

python main.py

This project was developed as part of a capstone challenge inspired by the "100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.  
The game logic and structure have been adapted and customized for this submission.
